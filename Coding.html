						  <p class="explanation">This piece of code seen above is code used to style all the big images you can see on all of these pages, lets break it down!</p>
						  	<p class="explanation">When styling a page the first thing to include in a code block is what you're styling by adding in a class or ID name, as you can see,
						  	this one is called hero meaning all of the hero images on screen, next we tell the computer how we want the images placed on the screen</p>
						  	<p class="explanation">We tell the computer to decide for itself what width it should be in comparison to its parent, we then tell the computer we want the image to be as tall as the screen!</p>
						  	<p class="explanation">All of the 'background' rules you see just tell the computer that the images is a background image and we then tell it how we want it placed on the screen.</p>
						  	<p class="explanation">Next comes the display, dont worry about this too much all we are saying here is we want the image to be flex meaning flexable and have the properties of 'flexbox', the image is already flexibly placed but now we can arrange it's children in a flexible way too!</p>
						  	<p class="explanation">The position you can see here is set to relative! This is a unusual position, what this does is it turns this element into an anchor point for other elements, meaning that I can place other elements so long as they are 'children' relative to the image, you can see here that we have something called 'flex-direction' which is set to column, this tells the parent being the image to align its children into columns as you can see on the main page!</p>
						  	<p class="explanation">Lastly I want to talk about the last three properties, two of which are very similar, the 'justify-content' and 'align-items' which are both set to center, are both very similar in the fact they align their children in the middle of their parent element the key difference is how they do this, 'justify-content' aligns its children on the main axis whilst the 'aling-items' aligns its children on the cross axis, using these together lets me place the items where I need them to be with ease. </p>
						  	<p class="explanation">Last but not least lets look into the weird negative value of 'margin-right' the reason I did this is due to the fact I set margins down the right and left of the page so I had universal margins for all of my content, to do this I set these margins on the body of the page meaning the image was affected also, nobody wants an image that's cut off by 50px! So the final step I took was to tell the image to ignore those preset margins I added by giving it a negative margin, essentially telling the image to grow past its container.</p>
